# CU-Professional-Portfolio
Professional Portfolio Project for Columbia University Full Stack Course by Henry Kim

## Description

Professional Portfolio Project was done through the intensive usage of HTML/CSS codes. The project required me to think very optimally, enabling me to label all class/ids clearly so that I won't get confused in the long run. While there was nothing in this module that required heavy coding skills, it was a tedious work ensuring that the application was mobile friendly, visually appeasing, while creating colors different from the demo to show my own "colors" as I'm creating my own personal portfolio.

## Developer Notes

Only one picture, the Learnitino project, was linked as that was my only finished product. Rest of the pictures will be given their own "href" as I complete more projects.

## User Story

AS AN employer,

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work,
WHEN I load their portfolio,
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application,
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

WHEN I click on the images of the applications,
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
